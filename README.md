# Digremoji

Pronounced:  Die - Grim - oji

### What is it?

A simple digraphical substitution cipher. It encodes text by mapping every possible pair of letters to a specific emoji. It can encode only letters and spaces. Letter case is lost, the message will always come out in all lower or upper case regardless of the input state.


### Why?

Most importantly it was amusing and interesting to me. I was learning about ciphers that used digrams and wanted to do something a bit "hands on" so I created this.
